                    <p>Founded in <strong>2018</strong>, SecureIndia began with a vision to protect people and properties from electrical and fire hazards through preventive safety measures and government-certified inspections. With the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) 2010 regulations making Electrical Safety Inspections mandatory, SecureIndia quickly established itself as a trusted authority in the field.</p>

                <div class="story-paragraph">
                    <p>Over time, our commitment to innovation led us to expand into home and building automation under the name <strong>SecureIndia Automations</strong>. However, we soon realized the need for better warranty and post-sales support within the smart home industry. To bridge this gap, we launched our own in-house range of reliable smart devices, combining quality hardware with professional installation and long-term service.</p>

                    <p>After testing several brand concepts, the automation division was finally rebranded as <strong>iSwift</strong> — a concise, modern identity representing everything SecureIndia stands for: safety, technology, and service excellence.</p>

                <div class="story-conclusion">
                    <p>Today, SecureIndia continues to lead India's Electrical Safety Inspection ecosystem while iSwift serves as its innovation wing — providing smart automation, consultation, and product solutions under one trusted network.</p>
